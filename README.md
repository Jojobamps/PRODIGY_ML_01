**Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.**
### The dataset I used can be found using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
- `train.csv` is the dataset that was used to train the model.
- `test.csv` is the dataset where the linear regression model was applied to predict prices.
- `submission.csv` is the result of predicted prices from the `test.csv` file.
- From the `data_description.txt` file, it was understood that:
  - `GrLivArea` represents the square footage.
  - `FullBath` represents the number of bathrooms.
  - `BedroomAbvGr` represents the number of bedrooms.
- `Task_1.ipynb` shows the process by which the linear regression model was created in order to predict the prices of houses based on the square footage, the number of bathrooms, and bedrooms.
- `SalePrice` was the feature used to represent the prices of the houses.
